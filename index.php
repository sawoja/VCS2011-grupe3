            Dinner usually refers to what is in many Western cultures the largest and most formal meal of the day, which some Westerners eat in the evening. Historically the largest meal used to be eaten around midday, and called dinner. In Western cultures, especially among the elite, it gradually migrated later in the day over the 16th to 19th centuries. However, the word "dinner" can have different meanings depending on culture, and may mean a meal of any size eaten at any time of day. In particular, it is still sometimes used for a meal at noon or in the early afternoon on special occasions, such as a Christmas dinner. In hot climates, people have always tended to eat the main meal in the evening, after the temperature has fallen.
